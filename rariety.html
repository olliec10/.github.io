<center><h1>Character Rariety</h1></center>
<center><p>In Monster legends there is something called Character Rariety. Character Rariety is the system that tells you how good and how hard it is to find that character. There are 5 different groups of Character Rariety and they are common, uncommon, rare, epic and legendary. These different groups define how good the character is.</p></center>

<ceneter><h2>Common</h2></ceneter>
<center><p>The common element is the easiest element to breed and there are only 9 commons. To begin with this character group is useful but then becomes weak when new character groups are unlocked. This group is also used in breeding a lot.</p></center>
        
<center><h2>Uncommon</h2></center>
        <center>The Uncommon element is the element you unlock when breed two commons together and you unlock it. When you unlock this element it is a real improvement to your last team and will be helpful in your teas to come.<p></p></center>
