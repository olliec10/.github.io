<center><h1>Elements</h1></center>
<center><p>In Monster Legends there are 10 elements. Each different element is strong against another. The 10 different elements are fire, nature, earth, thunder, water, dark, magic, light, legendary and metal. All these different elements also have a different range of powers. There are no good or bad elements but the element that does the most damage is the legendary element.</p></center>
<center><h2>Legendary Element</h2></center>
    <center><p>The legendary element is more of a category than an element. It is a breed of monsters that have the opportunity to reach a higher helth points level than some othe lower rariety monsters. This naturally points them in a higher ranked position. The legendary element is also less breedable meaning thare are less known combiinations you can use to breed a few legendary monsters. Below will be a strength chart.</p></center>
